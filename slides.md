## Introduction to GraphQL

---

### GraphQL

![GrapbQL](img/graphql.png)

--

* a query language for APIs
* views queries as graphs ðŸ¤·
* provides predictable results
* has a built-in type system
* [spec](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/October2016/) is a working draft

---

### Example Query

--

```graphql
query {
  coalMines {
    name
    location {
      address
      zipCode
      city
    }
  }
}
```

--

* fields: a coal mine may have a lot of data, e.g.:
  - name
  - location
  - website
  - shutdown date
* relation: every location can hold a reference to a geo API like OSM

---

### Example Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "coalMines": [
      {
        "name": "Zeche Carl",
        "location": {
          "address": "Wilhelm-Nieswandt-Allee 100",

        "location": {
          "address": "TwentmannstraÃŸe 125",
